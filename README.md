Project Goals:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and understand the crime patterns in Los Angeles by using Crime Data from 2020 to Present. This will not only provide insights into the nature of crimes but also help identify potential hotspots, temporal trends, and factors that might influence these crimes. The following are some potential objectives:

Temporal Analysis:

Identify trends in crime rates over time (e.g., monthly, annually).
Determine if certain times of the year or specific days are more prone to certain types of crimes.
Geographical Analysis:

Identify high-crime areas or 'hotspots' within Los Angeles.
Analyze if certain types of crimes are more prevalent in specific regions.
Nature and Type of Crime:

Classify crimes based on their severity and nature.
Determine the most frequent types of crimes and see if they correlate with specific areas or times.
Demographics:

Understand the demographics of victims and see if certain demographics are more prone to specific types of crimes.
Similarly, analyze if the demographic information about suspects can be correlated with specific types of crimes.
External Factors:

If possible, correlate crime rates with other external factors such as economic downturns, festivals, major events, etc., to see if they influence crime rates.
Predictive Analysis:

Based on the current data, attempt to predict future crime rates or potential hotspots.
By the end of this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of the crime situation in Los Angeles, which can aid law enforcement in better allocation of resources, policy-making, and public awareness initiatives.
